# This or That

`thisorthat` is an application designed to help users make decisions and
discover their preferences by comparing two items at a time. By presenting
pairs of options (e.g., car images), the application allows users to select
their preference, building a knowledge base that can then be used to inform
future decisions or understand preference trends.
